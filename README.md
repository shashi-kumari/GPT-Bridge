# GPT-Bridge
GPT-Bridge is a project that serves as a seamless interface between a user-friendly UI and OpenAI's GPT model. It receives input from the UI, processes it into a prompt, sends it to GPT for processing, and returns the generated response back to the UI. This project simplifies the integration of AI-powered responses into applications.
